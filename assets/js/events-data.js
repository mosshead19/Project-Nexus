Conducted on October 24, 2025 at the Research Laboratory, NIT Building, Palawan State University, the program focuses on transitioning Nexians into project-ready contributors within the Bantay-Klima project environment.

The workshop uses an intensive 1-on-2 mentorship structure that emphasizes practical application over theory. `,
    fullDescription: `Participants work directly on the Bantay-Klima codebase, learning modern development workflows such as trunk-based Git version control (git pull --rebase), atomic commit practices, simulated peer code reviews, and the application of the Nexus Style Guide in Python/Django development.

Beyond tools, Sync & Deploy develops essential collaboration skills. Trainees configure real Django environments, resolve merge conflicts, and participate in pair-programming activities that strengthen teamwork, problem-solving, and production readiness. By the end of the program, participants are assessed and classified as “Project-Ready”, enabling them to contribute meaningfully to active Project Nexus systems and deployments.`,
